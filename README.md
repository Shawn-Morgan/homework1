# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

# Description

After reviewing the code for this site, I found opportunities to improve code readability and sustainability so that it makes it easier in the future to update. 

In summary, I have added comments and description throughout both the html and css files so that it is easier to find the location of code driving website capabilities. I have also consolidated some css code for ease of update and maintainabilty in the future. Beyond that, I made other small changes including adjusting css so that is matches with how the html renders making it easier for other developers in the future to maintain and find more quickly where to make updates. I have also made various updates to accomdate accessibility needs.
